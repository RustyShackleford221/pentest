# Enumeration Scripts
Just some scripts I like to use.... penetration testing, bug bounties, OSCP, etc.

Enjoy!

## Enumeration
- **oscp-scan.sh**:  Reads IP addresses from a single file and looks for potential entry points. If you're building a custom OSCP script, perhaps this will give you some ideas. Probably not that handy in the real world, as there are way better tools available.
- **sub-recon.sh**: Leverages tools like enumall.py (recon-ng), cewl, etc to do some hardcore subdomain enumeration. Useful for a penetration test or for hunting bug bounties.
